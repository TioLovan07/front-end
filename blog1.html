                    <h3>7 Stages Before It Becomes Coffee Powder
                    </h3>
                    <h5>Maria / 6 October 2023</h5>
                    <img src="img/bg-6.jpg" alt=""/>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>
                            Coffee is a plant that grows widely in mid to highland areas. Coffee plants need
                            cool air to grow and produce lots of coffee beans. Apart from the planting
                            aspect, processing coffee beans into ground coffee also plays a very important
                            role. Nowadays, coffee is not just a drink, but has transformed into a tradition
                            and culture. Each region has its own superior coffee beans and methods of
                            processing them. Improper processing of coffee beans will damage the distinctive
                            taste and aroma produced. There are several stages that must be carried out
                            before coffee beans can become coffee powder that is ready to be brewed.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Choose quality coffee beans. Coffee beans that will be processed into coffee
                            powder must come from quality coffee beans. Choose coffee cherries that are
                            ripe, marked by red skin. The fruit size is uniform and protected from damage
                            such as holes and disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Peeling the skin The skin attached to the coffee beans must be peeled first.
                            Stripping can be done wet or dry. The dry peeling method involves drying the
                            coffee cherries in the sun. When the skin is dry enough, then grind it to remove
                            the attached skin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. Washing the coffee beans. The skin of the coffee fruit has been peeled, then
                            washed to remove the mucus that is still attached to the coffee beans. Washing
                            coffee beans can be done manually using a tub or bucket. Rub using a cloth or
                            sack, so that the mucus comes off easily. However, in large-scale production,
                            the use of a washing machine is very necessary to make it more effective and
                            efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. Drying The next processing of coffee beans into ground coffee is drying. This
                            stage aims to reduce the water content in the coffee beans, so that roasting
                            will be easier and faster. Place the coffee beans on a tray made of bamboo. Dry
                            in the sun, turning occasionally. Drying is done for 2 to 3 days until the
                            coffee beans are completely dry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5. Roasting the coffee beans. The aroma, color and taste of the coffee produced
                            is largely determined by the roasting method. Roasting coffee beans requires
                            paying attention to the right time and temperature. Stir the coffee beans slowly
                            and continuously until the color is even. Coffee beans that are not too dark in
                            color do not taste too bitter. However, on the contrary, the longer you roast
                            and make the coffee beans blacker in color, the more bitter the taste will
                            appear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6. Grinding into powder. Coffee beans that have been roasted optimally, then
                            need to be ground to become powder. The grinding process is carried out using a
                            special machine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7. Packaging coffee grounds Coffee grounds should be stored in the right place,
                            so that the quality is maintained. Aluminum plastic or glass jars can be the
                            right choice for storing coffee grounds. Store at room temperature around 20 to
                            30Â°C and avoid exposing the coffee grounds to water.
                        </p>
